## Troubleshooting: Frequently Asked Questions

1. What if a patient does not pick up when the student calls (perhaps they don't recognize student area code or number) and it was a Scenario type 1 visit in which the student was supposed to do the encounter alone first?

> Typically, the patients are informed beforehand that a student will be calling them, and are provided a time window in which the student may call. If after 2-3 attempts within the time window given to the patient, the patient still does not pick up, then the preceptor could try calling the patient and switching to a Senario type 2 visit where both student and preceptor are present. 

2. How do you decide which technology platform is best per each visit? 

> Each patient is bound to have their preferences for technology based on what phone type they have, and if they feel they want a video call or not. In this pilot study, many patients preferred FaceTime and WhatsApp to the virtual visit software platform currently used at our institution. As a result, preceptors and students will have to be ready to adapt to different mediums for different visits. Our suggestion is to get all of the technology set-up ahead of time to make it easy to switch applications as necessary. 

> If all technology options fail or are not able to be carried out (FaceTime, WhatsApp, Google Voice, Zoom), then it would be time to switch the visit to a simple telephone encounter with a conference call depending on which portion of the interview the student is in. 

3. How should students communicate with their preceptor when they are each in virtual visits separate from each other?

> We found that using EPIC's inbuilt chat button (seen in the image below) was very efficient. Since both the preceptor and the student will likely be charting or reviewing the chart of a patient, it is easy to see when either the preceptor or student has messaged and practical to use as either the student or preceptor may be on audio/video calls on their phones. Additionally, since EPIC's chat is built within, students can even share real-time questions/concerns with PHI since it is all contained within the EMR as opposed to using e-mail or texting.
