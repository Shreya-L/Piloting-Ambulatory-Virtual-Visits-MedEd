## WhatsApp For Business Privacy Set-Up Using Google Voice

PROs: Can call patient's from a real virtual number as opposed to an e-mail ID in Facetime. Can easily add preceptor on a call (given that they also have WhatsApp for business). Works well for patients who do not have iPhones but do have WhatsApps.

CONs: You have to save patient numbers before hand with their initials. For example if in one day you know you will have three WhatsApp encounters, you can add all the numbers to your contact list before hand using patient initials, and then delete them at the end of the clinic day. (The last point may actually be a PRO for those who like to have things organized and planned out in advance! You can even name your patients by initials and time you need to call them - I tried that once and it was helpful)

1. Download Whatsapp for Business for Android or iPhone

2. Select use a different number (you want this account to link with your virtual number)

3. Enter in your google voice number, you will see a screen that says it is being verified

4. Success! you have a new Whatsapp for business account. Fill in your name with whatever you want it to say. I made mine "Cleveland Clinic Telemedicine" so that patients would see that and know to pick up. 

5. As mentioned in the PROs/CONs section, prior to calling anyone on WhatsApp you will already need to have their information saved. Use initials +/- time of visit. 

6. Proceed to phone call. For the visits in which the student sees the patient alone, initiate a call with just you and the patient, hang up, discuss with your preceptor, and then go back to the WhatsApp for Business App and initiate a group call with your preceptor and the patient. 

7. At the end of the visit, or at least by the end of the clinic day make sure you delete the contact numbers from your phone!
