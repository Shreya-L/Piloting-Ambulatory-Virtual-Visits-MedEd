## WhatsApp For Business Privacy Set-Up Using Google Voice

PROs: Can call patient's from a real virtual number as opposed to an e-mail ID in Facetime. Can easily add preceptor on a call (given that they also have WhatsApp for business). Works well for patients who do not have iPhones but do have WhatsApps.

CONs: You have to save patient numbers before hand with their initials. For example if in one day you know you will have three WhatsApp encounters, you can add all the numbers to your contact list before hand using patient initials, and then delete them at the end of the clinic day. (The last point may actually be a PRO for those who like to have things organized and planned out in advance! You can even name your patients by the time you need to call them - I tried that once and it was helpful)

1. Download Whatsapp for Business for Android or iPhone

3. Locate your Google Voice number by logging into Google Voice at voice.google.com with your Gmail account. Click on **Settings** in the upper right corner. This will take you to the screen seen below where your voice number is listed under **Account** (If you have forgotten where to locate your google number click here). Enter this number into WhatsApp as seen in the image below. You will be prompted to confirm the number, select "Yes".

4. WhatsApp will then ask you to put in a verification code sent to your Google Voice number. To access this you simply log into your Google Voice account, click on the messaging icon (shown highlighted in green in the image below) and obtain the 6-digit verification code. Enter this code in WhatsApp as shown with the green arrow below.

5. You should then be seeing the following verifying code screen:

6. Success! you have a new Whatsapp for business account linked to a virtual number. You can fill in the name fields however you want, but the patient will only see the Google Voice number when you call them.

7. Proceed to phone call. For the visits in which the student sees the patient alone, initiate a call with just you and the patient, hang up, discuss with your preceptor, and then go back to the WhatsApp for Business App and initiate a group call with your preceptor and the patient.

8. As mentioned in the PROs/CONs section, prior to calling anyone on WhatsApp you will already need to have their information saved. We recommend saving patients for a particular clinic day as "[Time] Patient" (see image below) to prevent the use of saving patient initials or patient names. This can also help organize your workflow in knowing who you are calling at what time.

9. At the end of the visit, or at least by the end of the clinic day make sure you delete the contact numbers from your phone!
