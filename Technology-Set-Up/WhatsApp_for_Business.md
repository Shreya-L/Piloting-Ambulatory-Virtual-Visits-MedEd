## WhatsApp For Business Privacy Set-Up Using Google Voice

PROs: Can call patient's from a real virtual number as opposed to an e-mail ID in Facetime. Can easily add preceptor on a call (given that they also have WhatsApp for business). Works well for patients who do not have iPhones but do have WhatsApps.

CONs: You have to save patient numbers before hand with their initials. For example if in one day you know you will have three WhatsApp encounters, you can add all the numbers to your contact list before hand using patient initials, and then delete them at the end of the clinic day.
