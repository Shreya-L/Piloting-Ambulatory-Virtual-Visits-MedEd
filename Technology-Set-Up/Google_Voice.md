## Setting up Google Voice

### 1. Click [here](https://voice.google.com/u/2/signup) to be taken to the Google Voice website. You will need to log into a Gmail account of your choice for this step.  

### 2. If you see the either of following screens shown in the image below, it means your organization has not set-up your account to be Google Voice compatible. Try a different Gmail account if this happens to you:

### 3. Once you sign into a Gmail account that is compatible with Google Voice, you will see the screen below:

### 4. You can choose any area code and select any available number, this comes in handy if your personal number does not match the area code of where your medical school/institution is because patient's are more likely to pick up a familliar area code. For example, I selected 216 for the Cleveland area since this pilot was done at the Cleveland Clinic

### 5. You will then be prompted to verify the Google Number you have selected by providing your actual phone number. Google will then send a 6-digit code to your phone, that you then enter as seen in the images below.

### 6. You will then be taken to your Google Voice Home Screen as seen below. This is where you can use your new masked number to send messages as well as make phone calls. Phone calls from the US to anywhere in the US are free.

### 7. If you want to set up other applications, such as WhatsApp, using your Google Virtual number, you simply navigate to the messages screen in order to receive any verification codes required. (More details in the WhatsApp tutorial [here](https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/blob/master/Technology-Set-Up/WhatsApp_for_Business.md).
