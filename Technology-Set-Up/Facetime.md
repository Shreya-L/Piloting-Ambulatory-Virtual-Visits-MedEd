4. This is the section in which you can link your hospital/medical school email address to your FaceTime, so that patients will see this ID instead of your phone number when you call them. You do have to select an e-mail that is valid, because you will then be e-mailed a validation link to confirm your account.

5. When prompted to enter the code on your iPhone, put in the verification number received at the e-mail you entered in step 4. 

6. Now that your e-mail is verified, open iPhone **Settings** --> Select FaceTime as shown below:

7. Scroll down until you see the **CALLER ID** section. Make sure that only your institution's e-mail is selected with a check mark. Make sure you un-check your personal phone number, as well as anyother accounts you want to keep private. This ensures that when you make phonecalls for virtual visits the only thing patients will see, is your school or hospitals e-mail account.
