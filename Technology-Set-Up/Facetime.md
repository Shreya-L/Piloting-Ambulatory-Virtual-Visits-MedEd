## FaceTime Virtual Visit Privacy Set-Up

**PROs:** 
* Unlike WhatsApp, numbers do not need to be saved in order to call patients on FaceTime Audio or Video.
* Most patients with iPhones have gotten used to using FaceTime to communicate with friends/family during lockdown/quarantine so there is a possibilty patients could feel more comfortable with this medium as well as require less troubleshooting

**CONs:**
* If a patient does not have an iPhone

If patient does not have an iPhone or does not want to use FaceTime, can still consider Google Voice, WhatsApp for business, or Zoom.

4. This is the section in which you can link your hospital/medical school email address to your FaceTime, so that patients will see this ID instead of your phone number when you call them. You do have to select an e-mail that is valid, because you will then be e-mailed a validation link to confirm your account.

5. When prompted to enter the code on your iPhone, put in the verification number received at the e-mail you entered in step 4 

6. Now that your e-mail is verified, open iPhone **Settings** --> Select FaceTime as shown below:

7. Scroll down until you see the **CALLER ID** section. Make sure that only your institution's e-mail is selected with a check mark. Make sure you un-check your personal phone number, as well as anyother accounts you want to keep private. This ensures that when you make phonecalls for virtual visits the only thing patients will see, is your school or hospitals e-mail account.

8. Note: You can always go back to iPhone **Settings** --> **FaceTime** --> **CALLER ID** to switch your phone number and other accounts back on after patient visits, but this will NOT affect people being able to reach you. \
In other words, others will still be able to reach you at your phone number because the **Settings** --> **FaceTime** --> **YOU CAN BE REACHED BY FACETIME AT** will still show your number, and other e-mail accounts. The purpose of masking your own caller ID is to prevent a situation where patients can have your personal cell-phone number.
