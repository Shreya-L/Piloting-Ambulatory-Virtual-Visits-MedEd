## Setting Up Doximity for Voice and Video Calls

**PROs:**
- Good for phone call only with masking number (to a number of your choosing)
- Has a masked video call feature
- Easier to set-up than Google Voice + WhatsApp for business

**CONs:** 
- Cannot do a three way video like on WhatsApp and Facetime

## 4. On this screen, enter an e-mail account that will not only just be your login to Doximity, but will also be an e-mail that you can check for when Doximity sends you a verification e-mail. You need to verify Doximity through your e-mail before being able to use the phone App to make calls.

If you are seeing the following image in the iPhone or Android Doximity App, your account was not verified correctly. Sometimes the e-mail verification takes some time to send (up to 15 minutes, so if you don't see it immediately give it some more time.

## 5. In the phone application version of Doximity, you will first be prompted with the following screen after logging in to link your number. Here you provide your *real* number but this is not what will be shown to patients. The App will then prompt you to place an automated call to finish linking the phone (second image below).
