## Setting Up Doximity for Voice and Video Calls

**PROs:**
- Good for phone call only with masking number (to a number of your choosing)
- Has a masked video call feature
- Easier to set-up than Google Voice + WhatsApp for business

**CONs:** 
- Cannot do a three way video like on WhatsApp and Facetime

## 1. Go to https://www.doximity.com/ to start, you will see the image below. Even though you do not have an account, fill out your First and Last name and select "Find My Profile"

## 2. Next enter your information, Name, Date of Birth, then your Medical school details. Doximity allows you to connect with other members of your medical school as well and can be useful in the future.

## 3. Next, Doximity will ask you to verify a series of questions about places you have lived, cars you have registered in your name to verify your identity.

## 4. On this screen, enter an e-mail account that will not only just be your login to Doximity, but will also be an e-mail that you can check for when Doximity sends you a verification e-mail. You need to verify Doximity through your e-mail before being able to use the phone App to make calls. *Don't be alarmed if you do not get a verification e-mail quickly, it can take up to 15-20 minutes to send to your inbox!

## 5. In the phone application version of Doximity, you will first be prompted with the following screen after logging in to link your number. Here you provide your *real* number but this is not what will be shown to patients. The App will then prompt you to place an automated call to finish linking the phone (second image below).

## 6. On your home screen seen below, click on the settings icon to open up, this will open the "Dialer Settings" window which is where you can add your real number as well as Caller IDs.

## 7. To Set up Caller ID, click on the first row under My Caller IDs, which will bring up the window below. You can enter any number that is a valid number. I chose to just use the general medicine phone number listed on Google for the Cleveland Clinic. This feature in Doximity is great because as long as a number belongs to a landline or cell-phone user, you can mask yourself as that number. It is probably best to use a a generic number from your institution such as an appointment scheduling number, or a department number rather than picking someone else's office phone number etc.

## 8. It is important to note that your real phone number must be listed as "This Device Number" in the Dialer Settings Page. If it is not, you will not be able to make calls to patients. Having your real number listed here does NOT mean this is what patients see - they will still see your masked caller ID number.

### If during this step, you see the image below, it means that your account was not properly verified and you will need to go into your e-mail and ensure you followed the steps correctly to verify.
