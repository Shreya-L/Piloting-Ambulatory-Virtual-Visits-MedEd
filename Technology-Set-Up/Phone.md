## Phone Privacy Set-Up

**PROs**
- This method is the easiest and simplest to implement of all of the technologies we discuss
- When visits are running out of time, or a preceptor's schedule and student's schedule conflict, this method is the best choice for getting back on schedule. 

**CONs**
- loss of information if a video component of the virtual visit would have been more useful

## 1. Masking a number while calling patient

> To do this, simply add "`*67`" before dialing the rest of the patients number. So for example if a student is calling the number (234)-567-8910, they would dial *67-234-567-8910. 

## 2. Masking conference calls
> As long as whoever initiates the conference call uses `*67` to call the first person who will be joining the call, when the second person is invited to join the call they will only be able to see the person who invited them. 
> Heres what this looks like:
* Preceptor calls patient using `*67`
* Preceptor then calls student by pressing "Add call" while on the first call
* Preceptor presses "Merge Calls" and when they do so, the student can only see the preeptor's number, while the patient cannot see anyone's numbers since the patient was called using *67
