# Piloting Ambulatory Virtual Patient Visits During the Coronavirus Pandemic at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine
~ Shreya Louis, J. Harry Isaacson M.D., Neil Mehta M.D. 

This GitHub repo is meant to serve as a source of information and examples of the ongoing Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) virtual outpatient rotation pilot. We have been asked by a number of medical students at other institutions to share our note templates, workflow, and troubleshooting of tehcnological issues so that other institutions can also help jump start their virtual outpatient rotations and education. 

Since the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the Office of Civil Rights have declared a COVID-19 "Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehalth Remote Communications" seen [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html), HIPAA rules have been relaxed to allow the use of audio and video communication technologies, so long as they are not public facing (e.g. live streams are not allowed, or mediums that store videos for public viewings). 

While inpatient medical student rotations will be challenging virtually given the stress on health care workers at this time, the challenges of calling into team based learning that will vary based on real-time admissions, we decided an outpatient virtual visit pilot would have the ability to be more structured with scheduled visits with attendings who are already performing most of their visits virtually at this time anyways. The focuses of our workflow are ensuring student and patient protection of private information (cellphone numbers etc), education, and usefulness to the health care team. 

Currently our workflow depends on EPIC and phone or video app access. We use the following mediums: 
* EPIC
* FaceTime
* WhatsApp for business
* Google Voice
* Regular phone calling per patient's preference (if they do not desire a video encounter)

## Technology Set-Up for Privacy Protection

## Acquiring Patient Approval and Preferences for Televisit

## Setup #1: Student Sees Patient Alone First

## Setup #2: Student and Staff See Patient Together

### Questions and Contributions
We have added troubleshooting and walkthroughs with more details for Facetime, Whatsapp for Business with Google Voice, and general call merging tips/tricks in the folder "Technology Set Up"

If you have templates for other specialties your schools are using with EPIC, or other questions feel free to tweet me at @ShreyaLouis or e-mail at sxl1308@case.edu.
