# Piloting Ambulatory Virtual Patient Visits During the Coronavirus Pandemic at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine 
~ Shreya Louis, J. Harry Isaacson M.D., Neil Mehta M.D. 

This GitHub repo is meant to serve as a source of information and examples of the ongoing Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) virtual outpatient rotation pilot. We have been asked by a number of medical students at other institutions to share our note templates, workflow, and troubleshooting of tehcnological issues so that other institutions can also help jump start their virtual outpatient rotations and education. 

Since the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the Office of Civil Rights have declared a COVID-19 "Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehalth Remote Communications" see more [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html), HIPAA rules have been relaxed to allow the use of audio and video communication technologies, so long as they are not public facing (e.g. live streams are not allowed, or mediums that store videos for public viewings). 

While inpatient medical student rotations will be challenging virtually given the stress on health care workers at this time, the challenges of navigating real-time admissions and hour-to-hour changes, we decided an outpatient virtual visit pilot would have the ability to be more structured with scheduled visits with attendings who are already performing most of their visits virtually at this time anyways. The focuses of our workflow are ensuring student and patient protection of private information (cellphone numbers etc), education, and usefulness to the health care team. 

Currently our workflow depends on EPIC and phone or video app access. We use the following mediums: 
* EPIC
* FaceTime
* WhatsApp for business
* Google Voice - you will need a gmail account for this
* Regular phone calling per patient's preference (if they do not desire a video encounter)

## Technology Set-Up for Privacy Protection
Since most students do not have access to hospital/instituion phones and will have to use their own devices, masking phone numbers will be of importance when participating in virtual visits. In a phone call from student to patient, a `*67`placed before the patients number will suffice in masking the students number. Additionally, if an attending physician calls a patient and then adds a student in by merging the calls, the student's number is automatically hidden as well. 
This however becomes more complicated when a patient wants to Facetime or use WhatsApp video. For this reason we have created step-by-step walk throughs for how to setup Facetime, WhatsApp, and Phonecalls to mask student numbers in the folder "Technology Set Up." 

## Acquiring Patient Approval and Preferences for Televisit
Patient privacy and safety is of the utmost importance. All patients in our pilot were asked before hand by schedulers or by the attendings themselves if they would be okay with a medical student interviewing them (similar to how they ask beforehand for non-virtual visits). All the patient's in this study gave their approval and their preference for phone (audio only) or video (FaceTime or Whatsapp) and this was recorded in the note template (required for telemedicine notes). 

## Note Template for Virtual Encounter
Compared to typical in person encounters there are a couple of requirements for virtual encounter notes listed below for billing and ethical requirements: 
* Must state encounter type phone, video etc
* Statement such as "Patient agreed to this encounter being held via ___ Yes/No
* Documentation of all the people present in the encounter (e.g. any spouses, family members, as well as the student and staff physician)
* Patient location during virtual visit (e.g. home, work etc)
* Time the physician spends discussing in a virtual visit needs to be recorded (typically at end of note)
* Chief complaint, active concers, HPI, Review of Systems as one would normally have
* Relevant labs/results
* Assessment/Plan
* signature of student and staff physician attestation

Notice there is no physical exam or vitals because its a virtual visit. We have included a sample template in the Templates folder including the above information with some added features, the special fields are only compatible with EPIC at this time but can be changed per each institution's EMR. 

## Visit Scenario #1: Student Sees Patient Alone First


## Visit Scenario #2: Student and Staff See Patient Together

*Questions and Contributions*
There is an FAQ document that will be updated as things progress. 
If you have templates for other specialties your schools are using with EPIC, or other questions feel free to tweet me at @ShreyaLouis or e-mail at sxl1308@case.edu.
