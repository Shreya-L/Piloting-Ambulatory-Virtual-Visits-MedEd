# Piloting Ambulatory Virtual Patient Visits During the Coronavirus Pandemic at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine
Shreya Louis, Monica Yepes-Rios M.D., J. Harry Isaacson M.D., Neil Mehta M.D. 

This GitHub repo is meant to serve as a source of information and examples of the ongoing Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) virtual outpatient rotation pilot. We have been asked by a number of medical students at other institutions to share our note templates, workflow, and troubleshooting of technological issues so that other institutions can also help jump start their virtual outpatient rotations and education. 

Since the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Civil Rights have declared a "Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public Health Emergency" (see more [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html)), HIPAA rules have been relaxed to allow the use of audio and video communication technologies as long as they are not public facing (e.g. live streams are not allowed, or mediums that store videos for public viewings). 

Inpatient medical student rotations will be challenging to implement virtually given the stress on health care workers at this time and the added challenges of navigating real-time admissions and hour-to-hour changes. In contrast, outpatient visits provide more structure given that virtual encounters can be scheduled for particular times and most providers have transfered to virtual platforms for outpatient medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic anyways. 

The main focus of our workflow is to ensure student and patient protection of private information (cellphone numbers etc), education, and usefulness to the health care team. 

Currently our workflow depends on EPIC and phone or video app access. We use the following mediums: 
* EPIC - our students have remote EMR access for this which may vary across institutions
* Regular phone calling per patient's preference (if they do not desire a video encounter)
* Video platforms tried in this pilot: FaceTime, Google Voice, WhatsApp for Business depending on which platforms patients preferred and had access to. 

## Technology Set-Up for Privacy Protection
Since most students do not have access to hospital/instituion phones and will have to use their own devices, masking phone numbers will be of importance when participating in virtual visits. In a phone call from student to patient, a `*67`placed before the patient's number will suffice in masking the student's number. Additionally, if an attending physician calls a patient and then adds a student in by merging the calls, the student's number is automatically hidden as well. 
However, this becomes more complicated when a patient wants to Facetime or use WhatsApp video. 

For this reason we have created step-by-step walk throughs for how to setup the various technology platforms used in this pilot found in the folder [Technology Set Up](https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/tree/master/Technology-Set-Up) or by clicking the links below:

## Acquiring Patient Approval and Preferences for Televisit
Patient privacy and safety is of the utmost importance. All patients in our pilot were asked beforehand by schedulers or by the attendings themselves if they would be okay with a medical student interviewing them (similar to how they ask beforehand for non-virtual visits). All the patients in this study gave their approval and their preference for phone (audio only) or video (FaceTime or WhatsApp) and this was recorded in the note template (required for telemedicine notes). 

## Note Template for Virtual Encounter

See our Virtual Encounter Note Template compatible with EPIC [here](https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/tree/master/Templates)

Requirements for virtual encounter notes listed below for billing and ethical requirements: 
* Must state encounter type phone, video etc.
* Statement such as "Patient agreed to this encounter being held via ___ Yes/No
* Documentation of all the people present in the encounter (e.g. any spouses, family members, as well as the student and staff physician)
* Patient location during virtual visit (e.g. home, work etc.)
* Time the physician spends discussing in a virtual visit needs to be recorded (typically at end of note)

Virtual Physical Exam is limited, but some of the following elements have been implemented in Telemedicine:
* Phone visits: Is speech coherent, is patient able to speak in full sentences
* Video visits: Rashes (one patient was diagnosed with leukocytoclastic vasculitis with this), wlaking the patient through maneuvers such as pressing on painful areas, pulling on ears (to check for ear infection related pain), eye movements, observing potential tremors etc.

Typical note components, such as those below, are also included in the template
* Chief complaint, active concerns, HPI, Review of Systems
* Relevant labs/results
* Assessment/Plan
* Signature of student and staff physician attestation





## General Patient Encounter Workflow

To mimic in-person outpatient rotations, we came up with two "Scenario" types for how a student could participate in clinic - In Scenario 1 a student sees the patient alone first, while in Scenario 2 the preceptor and the student see the patient together for the entirety of the visit. These scenarios are listed below and have PROs and CONs of their own. The type of clinical scenario visit used, will depend on a preceptors schedule. Both students and preceptors should be prepared for the possibilty of needing to switch between visit types if necessary. 

One thing we found that is particularly useful for virtual visits in either workflow, is the use of EPIC's built-in chat. Since the chat is built within EPIC, students and preceptors can discuss patients in a secure fashion. We found this to be very useful in coordinating when preceptors and students are both free to sync back up to discuss patient visits since you can use the chat even when a student or preceptor may be on a virtual visit on their phone. The image below shows a sample screenshot that has been deidentified of any PHI.

## Visit Scenario #1: Student Sees Patient Alone First
<img src="https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/blob/master/Figures/Scenario1_workflow.png">

**PROs:** 
* Students get the most learning experience from seeing patients alone and synthesizing the patients concerns in a presentation to the preceptor followed by a chance to come up with an assessment and plan by themselves. 
* Preceptors are able to see other patients while the student is seeing their assigned patients - can help make clinic more efficient especially as virtual outpatient visits increase in light of the COVID pandemic. 

**CONs:** 
* If a patient does not pick up when a student tries to contact them, it may become necessary for the preceptor to contact the patient and transition the visit to a joint visit
* If scheduling does not work out where it is appropriate for the student and preceptor to meet up to discuss the patient plan and sync back up with the patient, a Scenario type 2 visit may be more important. 
* Likely to be some technology issues implementing this structure in the beginning, but should hopefully be easier as visits continue.

## Visit Scenario #2: Student and Staff See Patient Together

<img src="https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/blob/master/Figures/Scenario2_workflow.png">

**PROs:**
* This visit structure is good for when it is difficult for the preceptor and student to take time to meet separately from the patient to discuss the case due to time constraints. 
* There are less overall steps to this workflow, so it can be easier to implement from a technology standpoint that Scenario 1 since only one conference call has to be made followed by one wrap-up session. 

**CONs:**
* Student may not gain as much in this type of a visit because they will not get to present a patient or come up with an assessment and plan
* Since the preceptor will be in the visit with the student, they are not able to see their own patients while the student would otherwise be seeing their's. 

## Questions and Contributions
There is a [Troubleshooting FAQ](https://github.com/Shreya-L/Piloting-Ambulatory-Virtual-Visits-MedEd/blob/master/Troubleshooting-FAQs.md) document that will be updated as issues arise in virtual encounters at our institution as well as in others.
